# monopoly
Brute forcing moves in monopoly in order to create a "fitness" for each property. The spreadsheet has some visuals and cost calculations that give additional information about properties.

Of course, monopoly is a completely random game that is determined by dice rolls but this little project is meant to explore which properties give slight advantages over the course of thousands and thousands of moves. 

This code was written (poorly) on the plane back from mexico so its sloppy and redundant. It works though!
